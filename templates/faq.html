  <div class="card">
    <h3>What is heart disease prediction?</h3>
    <p>
      Heart disease prediction is a machine learning–based approach that
      estimates the risk of heart disease using patient health data and
      statistical models.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How accurate is the heart disease prediction system?</h3>
    <p>
      The accuracy depends on the dataset, selected features, and the machine
      learning model used. It provides probabilistic results, not guaranteed
      outcomes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Which factors are used to predict heart disease?</h3>
    <p>
      Factors include age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood
      sugar, ECG results, heart rate, and lifestyle indicators.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Can this system detect heart disease at an early stage?</h3>
    <p>
      The system can indicate early risk patterns but cannot replace clinical
      tests or professional diagnosis.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Is heart disease prediction safe to use?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. The system is safe for educational and awareness purposes, but it
      should not be used for medical treatment decisions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Can this prediction replace medical tests?</h3>
    <p>
      No. It cannot replace ECG, blood tests, or doctor consultations. It only
      assists in understanding potential risk.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What machine learning algorithms are used?</h3>
    <p>
      Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random
      Forest, and XGBoost are commonly used for heart disease prediction.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How does the model make predictions?</h3>
    <p>
      The model analyzes patterns in historical patient data and compares them
      with user input to estimate heart disease risk.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Can the prediction results be wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Incorrect or incomplete input data and model limitations may affect
      prediction accuracy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Is user data stored or shared?</h3>
    <p>
      No. User data is processed temporarily and is not stored or shared with
      third parties.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Who should use heart disease prediction systems?</h3>
    <p>
      Students, healthcare researchers, and individuals who want to understand
      heart health risks can use this system.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Can lifestyle changes reduce predicted heart disease risk?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management, and avoiding
      smoking can help reduce heart disease risk.
    </p>
